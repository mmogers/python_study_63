# Nicknames

If your file name is really long, you can give it a pseudonym, or nickname, as I believe the hip young things are calling them these days.  This will save you time every time you want to run a subroutine from that file.

ðŸ‘‰ Use `as` to nickname your file. Here I've used `tt` for the `test` file. 

```python
import test as tt

print("Countdown")
tt.countdown()
```
