```python
## test.py file ##############
import random

num = random.randint(10,100) # Need the random. to refer to the random library

def countdown():
  for i in range(num):
    print(i+1)

# Removed internal subroutine call.

### main.py file ###############

import test as tt # No such file as tt, that's the nickname I want to give the 'test' file

print("Countdown")
tt.countdown() # Referenced 'tt' file nickname before the call.
